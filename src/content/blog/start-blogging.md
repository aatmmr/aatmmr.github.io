  The why and how of finally getting started with blogging.
---

I was thinking about blogging for a long time and finally made a step forward to create this blog. It will be a place to keep findings, tutorials, little helpers, snippets and probably more things than I can think of now. It is meant for those searching for topics I touched and myself as a way to denote any findings for the future version of myself seeking for that thing once done in the past. I hope you learn something from the things I discovered or found useful to be published on this blog.

### How to stay in the loop?

Make sure to subscribe the [RSS feed](https://aatmmr.github.io/rss.xml) if you want to get the latest updates of the blog or to stop by every now and then.

### What about the stack?

The blog is runs on [Astro](https://astro.build) infused with the [AstroPater Theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/). The page is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/aatmmr/aatmmr.github.io) and deployed via GitHub Actions and I will make sure to document how this is done properly.

Cheerio and happy reading ðŸ¤“
