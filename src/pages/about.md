My name is Maik, and I am a Senior Solution Architect, GitHub Trainer, and Octowizard at <a href="https://solidify.dev/">Solidify</a>. I spend most of my day with GitHub, deep-diving into any corner of the platform and becoming an Octowizard, and I like to share my knowledge and findings.

## Badges

The close work with GitHub comes naturally with certificates that I obtained during my endeavors.
