My name is Maik and I am an DevOps Consultant and GitHub Flight Instructor at <a href="https://xpirit.com">Xebia|Xpirit</a>. I spend most of my day with GitHub deep diving into any corner of the platform becoming an Octowizard and like to share my knowledge and findings.

## Badges

The close work with GitHub comes naturally with certificates that I obtained during my endeavors.
